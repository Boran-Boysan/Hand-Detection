# Hand-Detection
In this project, I wrote the hand detection program using the OpenCV library.

# Project Structure
I completed detection training in YOLO using Google images and hand pictures I took myself.
I included the hand similarity values in the images that I trained with the dnn function in the OpenCV library
After turning on the computer camera, I determined wheter it was a hand based on the hand similarity values, and tehn placed the hand in rectangle.
